# Timber Game

Here is a game I made following a tutorial/course on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-game-programming-1). It uses C++ and SFML to make basic sprite animations and 
drawing objects to the screen. The game involves the player chopping down a tree while switching which side he chops on in order 
to avoid being squashed by the tree's branches as they get closer to the ground. Apparently, this is a clone of some popular game 
out there. Currently, the game is mostly wrapped into one giant file; however, I plan to modify it to make it more scalable.
